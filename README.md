# 100DaysOfMachineLearning
To hold myself accountable I chose to do this with the #100DaysOfMLCode challenge. The principle is that you code for at least an hour each day for 100 continuous days and log your progress.


cd Machine_Learning  
git init  
git add motivation  
git commit -m "100 days of ML"  
git push yourself_harder
